# 1. Clone the Repository:

### `git clone https://github.com/dorathip/keeper-app.git`

### `cd keeper-app`

# 2. Install Dependencies: Use a package manager like npm to install the dependencies. This will recreate the node_modules folder based on the package.json and package-lock.json files.

### `npm install`

This command will read the package.json file, download all the required dependencies, and place them in a newly created node_modules folder. After this, you can run your project as intended.

# 3. Start the application:

### `npm run dev`
